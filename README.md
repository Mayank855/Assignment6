# Machine Learning Model Comparison

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that trains and compares different machine learning models using the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`.

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Loads and splits the dataset
- Trains 5 different models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
- Evaluates each model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Tunes hyperparameters using:
  - GridSearchCV (for SVM)
  - RandomizedSearchCV (for Random Forest)
- Compares and prints the final best model based on F1-score

## 🛠️ Requirements
